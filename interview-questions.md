# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is essentially a statement that says a said value is true under certain conditions or criteria. This is often written as "if" "then" statements.

  Researched answer: Conditional statements such as if, else if and else execute code if a set of conditions are met.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is essentially the program used to write various types of code on your local computer. Github is the online website that allows people to push/pull and deploy their code on a website and allow other people to access that data and work on projects.

  Researched answer: Git is a control system that developers use to help track different versions of code and collaborate with other developers. Github is a online website that allows users to put projects on a remote server. The difference is git is downloaded on your computer to work on code with different people and github is a platform that is used to deploy git projects.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Equality operators

  Researched answer: Equality operators



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is the place on a value within an array. The first value would be 0 then 1, 2, 3, etc. A value is what the number is.

  Researched answer: My previous answer was without any notes, and my researched answer is from my notes. From what I wrote down in lecture an index is a location in an array or string and a value is a piece of data at an index location.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Repeating a set of computational procedures a specified number of times.

  Researched answer: An iteration is the repeated execution of code in a program.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: One person is driving and the other is navigating. The driver is the person writing down code, and the navigator is the person telling the driver what code to.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a development technique in which two programmers work together to code. The person who writes code is called the driver and the person who observes and navigates each line of code is called the navigator.
